        <h1>GeoExt mobile (GXM)</h1>
        
        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            While GeoExt offers a "Toolkit for Rich Web Mapping Applications" 
            these applications will not provide full functionality when accessed
            with mobile devices. With the ever-growing use of smartphones such
            as the IPhone, IPad or Android based devices to access internet
            resources, a rich toolkit for mapping applications directly targeted
            at these devices was missing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            GeoExt Mobile &mdash; or GXM &mdash; wants to fill this gap by 
            combining the powers of two extraordinary JavaScript libraries:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Sencha Touch ("the First HTML5 Mobile Web App Framework") can be 
                used to build web application that look and feel native on lots 
                of devices. It is in many ways the mobile counterpart of Ext JS
            </li>
            <li>
                OpenLayers ("Free Maps for the Web") is well known for its 
                feature richness for displaying and interacting with geographic
                data in the web. With the version 2.11 OpenLayers now supports 
                mobile devices due to the fact that it e.g. respects touch-based
                events.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            GXM wants to combine the powers of its base libraries and wants to 
            provide usefull widgets and components that can be the foundation of 
            your mobile-aware webgis applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Supported browsers</h2>

        <p>
            As GXM is based upon Sencha Touch, it supports the same browsers. 
            You should expect GXM code to work on the native iOS browser (iPad,
            iPhone, etc.), the native Android browser on most devices and the 
            desktop browsers Apple Safari or Google Chrome.
        </p>
